# Arium
Automation Testing Framework for AR(Unity) Applications.

## About Arium:
Arium is an automation testing framework for 3D applications built on top of Unity. It helps the Developers/QA to run functional tests on 3D apps on any platforms.
ie., Unity Editor,Android,UWP etc..

Arium comes with the basic Unity interactions:
- Animator
- DragHandler
- PointerClickHandler
- PointerEnterHandler
- PointerExitHandler
- RigidBody

[Arium - An Automation framework for Unity/XR](https://medium.com/xrpractices/arium-an-automation-framework-for-unity-xr-d51ed608e8b0)

## Setup:
1. Download Arium Unity Package https://github.com/thoughtworks/Arium/releases
2. Open your Unity project which needs to be automated.
3. Double click on the downloaded Unity package.
4. Select all and click on Import Button.

## Running Sample Test cases:
1. Open UnitySampleScene in the project hierarchy - Samples >> AriumSample >> Scenes >> UnitySampleScene.
2. Open Unity Build settings - File >> Build Settings
3. Click on Add Open Scenes.
    Note: Make sure the UnitySampleScene is selected 
4. Close Unity build settings window
5. Open TestRunner window in Unity - Window >> General >> TestRunner.
6. Expand the Arium hierarchy in the Test Runner - Arium >> AriumSampleTests.dll >> Samples >> AriumSample >> UnityTestRunner
7. Select PlayMode Tests and Right click on UnityTestRunner and Click on RUN.
8. Test Cases will start executing and results will be displayed on the TestRunner.

## Arium Usage:

### Instantiate Arium:

To use Arium framework, Arium should be instantiated inside the test class as mentioned below

#### syntax:

    Arium _arium = new Arium();
   
### Find GameObjects:

To find a Gameobject from the Unity Scene hierarchy using its name.

#### Syntax:
    _arium.FindGameObject("Display"); //To find "Display" gameobject but doesn't include inactive/deactive gameobjects in search. 
    _arium.FindGameObject("Display", true); //To find "Display" gameObject and include inactive/deactive gameobjects in search.
    
##### Paremeters:
    String - Name of the Gameobject.
    bool - flag to include inactive/deactive GameObject in search (by default false).
    
##### Return type:
    UnityEngine.GameObject

### GetComponents:

To retrieve the components attached to a GameObject

#### Syntax:
    _arium.GetComponent<Name of the component here>(Name of the GameObject here)
    
##### Paremeters:
    String - Name of the Gameobject.
    UnityComponent - UnityComponent type
    
##### Return type:
    UnityEngine.Component

### PerformActions:

To interact with the UnityGameobjects on runtime.

#### Syntax:
To click on a particular gameobject.
 
    _arium.PerformAction(new UnityPointerClick(), "Name of the gameobject here");
    
##### Parameters:
    Interaction - Type of the interaction need to be performed on a gameobject, in this case it is UnityPointerClick()
    String - Name of the Gameobject.
    
## Calling input methods on components based on EventSystem handled interfaces:
UnityEventSystemInteraction class is a static generic class which invoke functions on components based out of EventSystem Handled interfaces eg IPointerClickHandler in case of Unity UI Button Component. It containes 2 methods which can be called as follows:

### Method 1
     
     UnityEventSystemInteraction<T>.PerformAction("GameObject Name");
     UnityEventSystemInteraction<T>.PerformAction("GameObject Name", new PointerEventData(EventSystem.current));
     
     T : Interface based on IEventSystemHandler eg IPointerClickHandler, IDragHandler, IPointerDownHandler
     GameObject Name - Name of the GameObject on which action needs to be performed.
     AbstractEventData - Abstract base class for input event data by Unity
     
### Method 2    
     
     UnityEventSystemInteraction<T>.PerformAction(GameObjectRef);
     UnityEventSystemInteraction<T>.PerformAction(GameObjectRef, new PointerEventData(EventSystem.current));
     
     T : Interface based on IEventSystemHandler eg IPointerClickHandler, IDragHandler, IPointerDownHandler
     GameObject Name - Name of the GameObject on which action needs to be performed.
     AbstractEventData - Abstract base class for input event data by Unity
    

### Example:

     //Call IPointerClick methods on components attached on GameObject
     UnityEventSystemInteraction<IPointerClickHandler>.PerformAction("GameObject Name");
     
     //Call IPointerClick methods on components attached on gameObjectRef
     UnityEventSystemInteraction<IPointerClickHandler>.PerformAction(gameObjectRef);
     
     //Call IDragHandler methods on the specified GameObject Reference passing Pointer Position in PointerEventData()
     UnityEventSystemInteraction<IDragHandler>.PerformAction(gameObjectRef, new PointerEventData(EventSystem.current)
            { 
                position = new Vector2(positionXOfDrag,positionYOfDrag),
            });
